# solution-CAPTCHA
Introduction to the task:  
Here is the 2020 competition. Have you heard about CAPTCHAs? Maybe not. But you have seen them all over the internet for sure. Google CAPTCHA to learn more. Your task is to make a function called my_classifier.m that decodes three digits in an image. You have plenty of training data in imagedata/ and in labels.txt you have the ground truth decoding.

Your solution should be programmed reasonably well so it terminates within 5 minutes on the training data set. We will run your function my_classifier.m on our own data, which is similar but not identical to your training data. If you score above 40% average precision and fulfill the time condition,  you pass the lab. See the enclosed script evaluate_classifier.m and the example my_classifier.m for an explanation of the expected formats. You are not allowed to use the built-in ocr function in Matlab in your solution.
